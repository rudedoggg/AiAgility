## Standing Question
Give me a two-page executive summary of this project.

## Summary (Draft)
This project is currently in early structuring. The goal is to clarify scope, establish decision criteria, collect the right evidence, and produce decision-ready deliverables. The workspace is organized into Goals (what “good” looks like), Lab (evidence and knowledge buckets), and Deliverables (outputs for stakeholders).

Over the next iterations, the main focus is to tighten the feedback loop between new evidence and updated deliverables. The system supports two layers of conversation: a global thread that can reference the entire page, and bucket-scoped threads that are constrained to the bucket’s attachments and local history.

## Near-Term Next Steps
1. Confirm objective and non-negotiable constraints.
2. Populate research buckets with the minimum viable evidence.
3. Produce a first-pass deliverable draft and iterate.
